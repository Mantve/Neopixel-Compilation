# Neopixel-Compilation

This script features a compilation of multiple Neopixel led strip light modes, with the ability to change modes and colors on the fly.

The script is stable, saving feature should work. However, the code was written in 2016, so cleanups and improvements are needed.

Looking at this after many years, lots of code sections do not make any sense at all. Unfortunately, I cannot improve or test it at the moment due to not owning a Neopixel strip anymore.
